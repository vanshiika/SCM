  <div class="headline"><h1>THE NOD</h1>by Kayo Chingonyi </div>
  <div class="para"><p>When we're strangers that pass each other / in the street, it will come<br> down to this tilt / of the head — acknowledging another / version of<br> events set in a new-build / years from now, a mess of a place filled / with<br> books and records, our kids thick as thieves / redefining all notions of<br> mischief. <br>
Perhaps our paths will cross in a city / of seven hills as the light draws<br> your face / out from the bliss of anonymity. / Maybe you’ll be stroking the<br> goose-down nape / of a small child with eyes the exact shade / of those I<br> met across a room at the startof this pain-in-the-heart, this febrile<br> dance. </p></div>
